This study focused on the design and implementation of an integrated telemetry and control system for high altitude weather balloons, using Arduino, Raspberry Pi platforms, and the wireless communication protocol NRF. The goal of the project was to develop a specialized system capable of measuring and transmitting meteorological monitoring data from balloons operating at altitudes much higher than usual. Using the combined use of Arduino, Raspberry Pi platforms and the NRF24L01 wireless protocol, the system enables the collection, control, and processing of meteorological data remotely. A user-friendly graphical interface was also created which displays the data, generates graphs of the data and time/day and real-time balloon location and path tracking. 

Hardware used:
- Arduino Uno
